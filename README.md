# DSA_Project_3rd_sem
A student-teacher portal system where the student and teacher users can do simple operations similar to storing student data, academic performance, attendence etc. The student user can later access their own login portals to view their respective details.

To use the above code both the .py files must be present.
Note:- portal.py is the main file and Q2 contains some data stuctures in it which is also needed for smooth running of the code.
